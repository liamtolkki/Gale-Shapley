I have implemented the algorithm in completion.
I have the testing cases in the testing/ directory.
This includes the inputs and respective outputs.

---GALE-SHAPELY ALGORITHM INSTRUCTIONS---
To run the GS algorithm, the following command must be run:
"python3 assignment1.py input.txt"
input.txt is the name of the input file to be processed.
To create a randomized input file, see the instructions 
for running the input file generator below:

---GENERATOR INSTRUCTIONS---
I have also created a generator that creates input
files for testing purposes. This is how to run the 
generator program:
execute the following command: "python3 GS-Input-Generator.py"
This program will prompt for 3 inputs:
1. # of men
2. # of women
3. file name (the file to dump the input data to)
Once the 3 inputs are received, the generator will
create an input file with the specified name in the
'testing/' directory.
